# Measuring Effects of Gender on Online Social Conformity

This study investigated the impact of majority - minority group gender composition, gendered user cues (names and avatars) and gender-typed questions, in triggering gender-stereotypical conformity in an online quiz. <br/>
We observe that participants conformed to a majority consisting more men than women in stereotypically masculine questions, and a majority consisting more women than men in stereotypically feminine questions. <br/>
The effect was also heightened when we used gendered avatars to represent users, than their first names. <br/>

I created a simple web application to simulate an online quiz, where our participants answered a set of objective questions based on sports, fasion and general knowledge questions.<br/>
The quiz was followed by a big-five questionnaire (which captured their personality traits).<br/>
For more information on this experiment, please refer to our paper at https://www.senuriwijenayake.com/papers/2019/CSCW19.pdf<br/>
